Memory Highlights

Memories structure people’s lives. Memories can be specific to an individual or shared with family, friends, and/or a significant other. People often revisit memories while reminiscing, and memories also help shape a person’s character.

## Problem

Remembering memories can be difficult, as the brain can warp memories and even forget them all together. If you forgot something, did it ever exist to begin with? A way to collect memories for yourself, between loved ones, to share with the whole world would be beneficial to those who it’s important to.

## Evidence

1. [Rambling Old Man Monologue](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RamblingOldManMonologue) shows that people wanting to convey their memories to others is a widespread enough issue that there is an entire trope dedicated to it, based from reality.
2. [Remembered.com](https://remembered.com/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20Remembered.com%20%2D%20Free%20Online%20Memorial%20Websites&text=Enshrine%20your%20photos%2C%20memories%2C%20and,Easy%20as%201%2C%202%203%20!) shows that although there are some websites dedicated to memories, these are mostly of deceased relatives, and not used for simply remembering good times from all times, not just deceased ones.
3. [I'm afraid of getting old and forgetting things.](https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/tkw1qi/im_afraid_of_getting_old_and_forgetting_things/) shows how some people are terrified at the thought of not remembering all their best moments.
4. [The Fear of Forgetting Them](https://www.coachingwithkrista.com/fear-of-forgetting-them/) shows how, after someone is deceased, oftentimes people can be afraid of forgetting what they were like.
5. [Memory Hoarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeople/comments/1cn5rdc/memory_hoarding/) shows that oftentimes people will keep things that remind them of good times in boxes or someplace safe. What if they could do this, but with actual stories instead online?
6. [How do I get over sentimental hoarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/14q84il/how_do_i_get_over_sentimental_hoarding/) discusses this person's issues with not wanting to get rid of physical items that remind them of a fond memory, over fear of forgetting the memory. If they had a way to remember the memory, they wouldn't have to hoard these items.
7. [RememberingALife.com](https://www.rememberingalife.com/blogs/blog/honoring-loved-ones-through-stories) shows the writer's husband, after a terminal diagnosis, did not want his memories to die with him, and recorded 60 hours worth of memories.
8. [ModernHeirloomBooks.com](https://www.modernheirloombooks.com/35-questions-to-ask-to-prompt-memories-of-lost-loved-one-tribute-book) shows that some people find collecting stories and memories of people to be therapeutic.
9. [Is there a way to find out a deceased person’s history without direct ties to their bio family?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/qznnon/is_there_a_way_to_find_out_a_deceased_persons/) shows that although people want to find out more about relatives long deceased, sometimes it can be difficult and you must be sleuthy.
10. [I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of losing the experiences and memories of people I loved.](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1auzunz/im_not_afraid_of_death_im_afraid_of_losing_the/) shows how people are afraid of dying because they'd be forgetting all of their best experiences and people they loved. It would be beneficial if they knew their best memories were kept somewhere safe.

## Comparables

1. Facebook
- You can post your memories to your profile, and collaborate on them with others. However, you cannot add them at certain points in time (ie if this happened 20 years ago, you can say this happened 20 years ago but it won’t be sorted to 20 years ago).
2. Shared photo albums
- People can create albums and share them with selected others such that anyone with access to that photo album can add their pictures. However, this only allows image media. Memories written down as text would serve useful as well.
3. Scrapbooking
- Scrapbooking is generally a physical hobby rather than virtual, which makes collaborative sharing more difficult (you would have to be in the same physical location to view the scrapbook memories)

## Features

1. **Profiles that List Memories**: Under each person's (character) profile, storytellers can add a memorable story that includes the character. Of course, only if the character approves of it, as to prevent bullying. This helps storytellers remember their most memorable moments and reminds characters of those fun times too! Listeners can view these stories and get a sense of what the characters involved in the story were really like, bolstering a sense of connectedness. If a memory has multiple people, you can tag those people as well. People can also respond and add details left out.
2. **Chronological Timeline**: When viewing a person's profile, you would see all the memories people added to their profile in chronological order. This helps remind the storyteller and characters when exactly these memories took place, how old they were, what stage of their life, etc. This also puts it into perspective for the listener. For instance, the listener could see fond memories of what their parent was doing at the listener's age.
3. **Memory Prompts/Questions**: If a storyteller doesn't really know what to add, but still wants to add something to a character's board/profile, there will be prompts such as "What was their favorite color?", "What was their sense of humor like?", etc. This helps start the storyteller to think carefully about what the character was like, giving a bigger glimpse of the character's personality to the listener.
4. **Collections of memories**: People may want to group memories in different ways depending on who is involved in the memories or who they want the memories to be visible to. Having collections of memories could allow users to organize their memories and specify who else should have access to view or edit these memory collections.
5. **Tagging others (“@” feature) to connect shared experiences.**: Similar to the feature above, tagging others is another way to make a memory visible to the relevant people.
6. **AI assistant**: To align, polish, and merge stories from multiple people. This can be something similar to Spotify’s annual “Spotify Unwrapped” that people are often looking forward to. It would be a good way for people to reflect back on their year/month/whatever time duration we choose without having to go through everything manually.

## Ethical Analysis

### Stakeholders

#### 1. Direct And Indirect Stakeholders

**Observation**: Primary stakeholders include individuals recording memories (users), co-participants tagged in shared stories, and long-term family or community members who access them later. Secondary stakeholders include data storage providers and potential third-party developers.


**Design Response**: Implement clear consent mechanisms before sharing or tagging others in memories, and provide visibility controls (who can see/edit each memory).

### Time

#### 2. Long-Term Health and Well-Being

**Observation**: In the short term, users may experience nostalgia and joy from revisiting memories. In the medium term, potential emotional risks arise (e.g., re-triggering grief). In the long term, how can users deal with these memories if their relationship breakup? (no longer connected or somebody died)


**Design Response**: Add legacy and archival features that let users choose what happens to their memories posthumously, and include emotional support prompts or opt-outs for sensitive content.

#### 3. Reappropriation:

**Observation**: People may use the app to spread propaganda/disinformation/bullying/hate-speech, that isn’t necessarily fact checked or real.

**Design Response**: If you get reported too much for propaganda/disinformation/bullying/hate-speech, your stories get limited to friends-only.

#### 4. Sustained Friendships

**Observation**: Forget 5 years, what about 70 years? In 70 years you can reflect on a memory, see a long-lost friend, and connect with them again. This leads to closer friendships because you remember all the good times together.

**Design Response**: Implement good ways in seeing who participated in a memory.

### Values

#### 5. Choose Desired Values

**Observation**: The main three values we would like our app to embody are:
Autonomy: users can control their stories with equal visibility of contributions
Inclusion: accessible for different ages with memory generate motivation and abilities
Community: encouraging users to share memories with storytelling.

**Design Response**: Prioritize inclusive design: voice input for elders, captioning for accessibility, and moderation tools to prevent exclusion or misinformation in shared stories.
